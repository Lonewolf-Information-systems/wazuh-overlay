Wazuh Overlay
================
### https://github.com/wazuh  
### Unofical Ebuilds for WAZUH.

This is a "Wazuh" overlay -- an empty overlay to use as the starting point
for collaborating with Gentoo/Funtoo/Sabayon Linux. To start using the overlay, perform the
following steps:

1. Review COPYRIGHT.txt and LICENSE.txt. What is provide are reasonable defaults,
   using the GNU General Public License Version 2. If you are using existing ebuilds from
   Gentoo Linux and/or Funtoo LInux, then the copyright information is probably
   accurate. Otherwise, you will want to change the copyright notice to read:

::

  Copyright 2014 Firstname Lastname. Distributed under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License version 2.

2. Modify ``profiles/repo_name`` and enter a single-word name for your repository.

3. Modify this README.rst file to accurately reflect how to contribute. You should
   be able to remove this top part and simply use what follows it as a template.

4. Add ebuilds :)
